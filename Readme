This file accompanies the paper entitled "A machine-learning approach to modeling picophytoplankton abundances in the South China Sea" submitted to Progress in Oceanography and introduces each file (including the source data file) needed for using the four machine learnig algorithms to predict picophytoplankton abundances and Chlorophyll (Chl) a concentration in the South China Sea.

*************Metadata for essential files*************************

****Data files*****
NewPico.csv: original data of in situ picophytoplankton abundances and Chl a concentration collected during six cruises (July 18 to August 16, 2009; January 6 to 30, 2010; October 26 to November 24, 2010; April 30 to May 24, 2011; August 24 to September 24, 2011; July 30 to August 16, 2012) in the South China Sea. This data file also contains simultaneously measured temperature (Temp; unit: ºC), Salinity (Sal), nitrate + nitrite concentration (NO3; unit: µM), phosphate (PO4; unit: µM). Chl: in situ Chl a concentration (µg/L). Pro: Prochlorococcus abundance (cells/mL). Syn: Synechococcus abundance (cells/mL). Peuk: Picoeukaryote abundance (cells/mL). HB: abundance of heterotrophic bacteria (cells/mL). lon: Longitude (ºE). lat: Latitude (ºN). Bot_Depth: bottom depth of the station (m). DOY: Date of the year starting from 1 January. Chl0: in situ surface Chl a concentration (µg/L) corresponding to the Chl a concentration at 0 m. T0: in situ surface temperature (ºC). I0sat: surface daily Photosynthetically Active Radiations (PAR; unit: E m-2 d-1) obtained from  http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/. 

np.Rdata: the organized dataframe ready for running machine-learning algorithms. 

SCS_surface_simulation.csv: the source data file for predicting the seasonal surface climatology of the South China Sea. Chl_su: Mean surface Chl a concentration in summer. PAR_su: Mean surface PAR in summer. SST_su: Mean Sea Surface Temperature in summer. The rest columns are for autumn (*_au), winter (*_win), and spring (*_sp).

seats8d.csv: the source data file for hindcasting the Chl a concentrations and picophytoplankton abundances at the SEATS station (116 ºE, 18 ºN). 

Full_BRT_Model.Rdata: The fitted gbm models using full data (from np.Rdata). It contains c_brt_full (the gbm model for Chl a), p_brt_full(the gbm model for Prochlorococcus), s_brt_full (the gbm model for Synechococcus), e_brt_full (the gbm model for picoeukaryotes).

etopo05.nc: the global bathymetry netcdf file.
